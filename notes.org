* Introduction
- don't need to know dates from textbook
- know major ideas, concepts, events, ideas, approaches
- Pay attenton to stuff not discussed in lectures
* Early Technologies
- Lecture 2

  What is technology? Cars, rockets, airplanes, computers are products of systems
  - technology :: a system that leads to creation of predetermined products (large scale, standardized)
    + a system which leads to usually mass production of objects of a predetermined pattern
    ex: Education is a technology, and the product is you

*** Africa
- c. - circa 2.5 million years ago
- prehistoric period before 3200BC
**** The Great Rift Valley
- birth of technology
***** Oldowan tools (flake tools)
2.5 mil. - 1.5 mil.
- first example of technology
- not very standardized
- take hard stone, hit softer stone, and you get a flake that chips off that you can use as a tool
- not as precise as later stone tools
- quartz, basalt, obsidian
- they didn't use flint (which is ideal) because it was not around
- created by <<<Australopitchecus>>> (<<<Lucy>>>)
    + bipedal, but not walking upright
***** Acheulean tools (core tools)
1.5 mil - 100000
- core tools
- predetermined pattern, they all look fairly similar
- new method of production
- reverse process of flake tool
  + big stone carved into tool, flakes discarded
- <<<Homo Erectus>>> (<<<Turkana Boy>>>)
  + bipedal
  + closer to us (Homo Sapiens)
- large stone tools
- made of flint
  + really sharp, we still use it for surguries today
- flint hand axe
- makes hunting possible
  + can kill animal
  + more meat
***** Fire
- c. 1 million
   cannot make fire, can move it into caves though
- stone tools
- more meat
- new proteins -> bigger brains
  + c. 100000 Homo Sapiens
  + bigger brains -> abstract thinking -> new technologies
  + using technologies to survive, get food, and not be eaten by other animals hunting humans
*** Agriculture
**** Mesopotamia
- c. 10000BC
- at the time, it was like a paradise
  + ice age, cold, lack of food, have to constantly walk and move
  + lots of plants, things green and growing, lots of food in Mesopotamia
  +
    - domestication
    - animals got used to human garbage
    -
**** Domestication of animals
7500BC
- animals got attracted to human garbage, start hanging around
- sheep, goat, pig, cow
- *shift from "eat when you catch it asap" -> 'save the best for the next year'*
  + surplus of food 2% -- first time!!
**** Surplus of food
can focus on things other than survival
- Division of labor
  + preserving extra food
- Specialization
- Political elite
  + someone in charge of food
- First towns
  + mud huts
  + large centres of human activities

*** Catalhoyuk
- c 7000BC
- one of the older towns
- there were others, but they didn't survive
- standardization of
  + housing
  + construction
    - mud bricks, same material
  + ruled by those who controlled food surpluses
- wealth measured by how much surplus food you have (no money)
- interconnected houses
  + save building materials by building less walls
- population about 6000
- furnaces
- beds have dead ancestors below, they slept with the dead
- kitchen, grinding wheel, ladders
- fairly modern

*** Plow
4000BC
- first civilization, cities, monumental buildings
- agriculture -> first civilization
- large surplus of food

*** Sumerians
- first pyramids
- houses made of mudbricks, had warfare, not much left
- Egyptians used their technology, they made pyramids first (ziggurats)
- invented lawyers
- plow
- government
- religion
- math
- writing
- time
- first paid army
- metallurgy
- 1900BC captured by Amorites (Babylonians)
- *iteraction/trade with Egyptians*

**** Uruk
- c. 4000BC
- population 50000
- bureaucracy, army
- standardization of government buildings
- permanent construction with stone
- roads
**** Religion
- every city has a ziggurat, which is a temple
- each city protected by a deity, usually female
- bring donations, surplus of food, animals
- priests keep a count of dues provided to temple
- records kept for who donated what, needed a better system (writing)
**** Writing
3200BC
- clay tablets
- cuneiform (wedge shaped)
  + first written language we know of
- issuing receipts for trade

***** Alphabet
3000BC
- Epic of Gilgamesh
  2000BC
  + first known story
- Hammurabi's Babylonian law code
  1700BC
  + first known legal/law system
  + what is the punishment for doing certain things
**** Math
**** Clock
- modern concept of time
- calendar
**** Transportation
- people want to trade with Sumarians because they had a lot of wealth
***** Wheel
**** Army
- weapons
- armour
- metallurgy (making weapons and armour out of metal)
**** Gold
6000BC
- visible
- soft
- shaped by pounding
**** Copper
5000BC
- harder than gold, better for weapons
**** Silver
4000BC
- harder, more durable
- almost impossible to work with without smelting
- almost always impure
**** Smelting
***** Bronze
- mix of tin and copper
- really good for weapons
- melt pretty easily
- can pour into any shape you want
- mass production of weapons
- every sword, helmet is the same, and the same quality
- first thing made that you do not find in nature on a molecular level
***** Iron
- 15000BC China
*** Egyptians
- surrounded by large desert, so protected from other humans
- nile river is unique
  + good for transportation
    - water current South -> North
    - wind North -> South
- invented sails for boats, 3000BC
- predictable flooding, unlike the area the Sumerians were in
  + new layer of topsoil each time, acts like fertilizer
  + huge surplus of food
  + Nilometer
    - wooden stick to measure height
    - based on observation of stars they could predict flooding and surplus of food
    - Pharaoh kept secret
    - this knowlege kept secret from commoners (farmers)
    - knew when solar eclipse is happening, used religion to scare the peasants
  + good observers of the sky
    - did NOT come up with astronomy
- canals for farming, and store water for farming
  + sumerians had canals, but did not store water
  + water storage allowed for 2 harvests
- Menes first Pharaoh
  3200BC
- control of centralized granary (money 1500BC)
- largest surplus of food

**** Was Egyptian civilization as technologically advanced as is generally believed?
Probably not.
- preoccupied with afterlife
  + engineering scemes just produced gigantic tombs
- could have done so much more with the resources spent
- borrowd most technology from Sumerians
- didn't really do scientific investigation
- good observation though
- not as influential, because of religion
- religion dictated that most resources were spent on tombs instead of public buildings or advancing society

**** Money


**** Pyramids
food surplus funneled into building pyramids
- large tombs
- not accessible to public
- progression of design
- starts with step pyramids
- made by paid workers
- when the nile is flooded, farmers have no work
- Pharaos pays farmers to work -> they don't overthrow the government because they're busy
- wealth was spent on building gigantic tombs. Resources could have been spent better on more cool things

***** Mastaba
3100BC
- tombs
- bunker like structures
***** Step Pyramids
- created by Imhotep 2650BC minister of Djoser
- basically mastabas stacked on top of each other
***** Sneferu's pyramid
2613BC
- bent pyramid
***** Great Pyramid of Giza
2500BC
- fill the gaps in the step pyramid to make the smooth ramp
- built over 20 years by 20000 men
- over 2.4 million blocks of stone, each block over 1500kg (1 ton each)
- blocks are prefabricated, transported by water
**** Mummification
- did not do it for science (anatomy)
- it was all about immortality
  + stop decomposition of body by removing internal organs
  + dehydration
  + organs were destroyed before they were studied
  + brain liquidized by bronze hook, discarded
    - did not think the brain had any purpose
    - they thought the heart was the important thing
  + all internal organs removed except for heart
  + internal organs dissolved or destroyed within body before they could be examined
  + duty for these people was to prepare the body for the afterlife, no time to study anatomy
*** Hyksos
1700BC
Nomadic people
- Captured Egypt, got rid of Pharaos
- Egyptians eventually recaptured, and put Pharaos back in charge, but
- Egypt never the same. They thought different, never felt powerful as a society again
- Captured again by Alexandria and then the Romans

*** Irrigation
- mathematics
- engineering
- labour organization
- measurement system
- centralized project management
*** Greeks
- first to separate divine from natural
- scienctific method, new technologies
