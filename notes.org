* Introduction
- don't need to know dates from textbook
- know major ideas, concepts, events, ideas, approaches
- Pay attenton to stuff not discussed in lectures
* Early Technologies
- Lecture 2

  What is technology? Cars, rockets, airplanes, computers are products of systems
  - technology :: a system that leads to creation of predetermined products (large scale, standardized)
    + a system which leads to usually mass production of objects of a predetermined pattern
    ex: Education is a technology, and the product is you

*** Africa
- c. - circa 2.5 million years ago
- prehistoric period before 3200BC
**** The Great Rift Valley
- birth of technology
***** Oldowan tools (flake tools)
2.5 mil. - 1.5 mil.
- first example of technology
- not very standardized
- take hard stone, hit softer stone, and you get a flake that chips off that you can use as a tool
- not as precise as later stone tools
- quartz, basalt, obsidian
- they didn't use flint (which is ideal) because it was not around
- created by <<<Australopitchecus>>> (<<<Lucy>>>)
    + bipedal, but not walking upright
***** Acheulean tools (core tools)
1.5 mil - 100000
- core tools
- predetermined pattern, they all look fairly similar
- new method of production
- reverse process of flake tool
  + big stone carved into tool, flakes discarded
- <<<Homo Erectus>>> (<<<Turkana Boy>>>)
  + bipedal
  + closer to us (Homo Sapiens)
- large stone tools
- made of flint
  + really sharp, we still use it for surguries today
- flint hand axe
- makes hunting possible
  + can kill animal
  + more meat
***** Fire
- c. 1 million
   cannot make fire, can move it into caves though
- stone tools
- more meat
- new proteins -> bigger brains
  + c. 100000 Homo Sapiens
  + bigger brains -> abstract thinking -> new technologies
  + using technologies to survive, get food, and not be eaten by other animals hunting humans
*** Agriculture
**** Mesopotamia
- c. 10000BC
- at the time, it was like a paradise
  + ice age, cold, lack of food, have to constantly walk and move
  + lots of plants, things green and growing, lots of food in Mesopotamia
  +
    - domestication
    - animals got used to human garbage
    -
**** Domestication of animals
7500BC
- animals got attracted to human garbage, start hanging around
- sheep, goat, pig, cow
- *shift from "eat when you catch it asap" -> 'save the best for the next year'*
  + surplus of food 2% -- first time!!
**** Surplus of food
can focus on things other than survival
- Division of labor
  + preserving extra food
- Specialization
- Political elite
  + someone in charge of food
- First towns
  + mud huts
  + large centres of human activities

*** Catalhoyuk
- c 7000BC
- one of the older towns
- there were others, but they didn't survive
- standardization of
  + housing
  + construction
    - mud bricks, same material
  + ruled by those who controlled food surpluses
- wealth measured by how much surplus food you have (no money)
- interconnected houses
  + save building materials by building less walls
- population about 6000
- furnaces
- beds have dead ancestors below, they slept with the dead
- kitchen, grinding wheel, ladders
- fairly modern

*** Plow
4000BC
- first civilization, cities, monumental buildings
- agriculture -> first civilization
- large surplus of food
- made science possible
- it created the possibility for spare time because of surplus of food
- people can sit down and think 'why'

*** Sumerians
- first pyramids
- houses made of mudbricks, had warfare, not much left
- Egyptians used their technology, they made pyramids first (ziggurats)
- invented lawyers
- plow
- government
- religion
- math
- writing
- time
- first paid army
- metallurgy
- 1900BC captured by Amorites (Babylonians)
- *iteraction/trade with Egyptians*

**** Uruk
- c. 4000BC
- population 50000
- bureaucracy, army
- standardization of government buildings
- permanent construction with stone
- roads
**** Religion
- every city has a ziggurat, which is a temple
- each city protected by a deity, usually female
- bring donations, surplus of food, animals
- priests keep a count of dues provided to temple
- records kept for who donated what, needed a better system (writing)
**** Writing
3200BC
- clay tablets
- cuneiform (wedge shaped)
  + first written language we know of
- issuing receipts for trade

***** Alphabet
3000BC
- Epic of Gilgamesh
  2000BC
  + first known story

  1700BC
  + first known legal/law system
  + what is the punishment for doing certain things
**** Math
**** Clock
- modern concept of time
- calendar
**** Transportation
- people want to trade with Sumarians because they had a lot of wealth
***** Wheel
**** Army
- weapons
- armour
- metallurgy (making weapons and armour out of metal)
**** Gold
6000BC
- visible
- soft
- shaped by pounding
**** Copper
5000BC
- harder than gold, better for weapons
**** Silver
4000BC
- harder, more durable
- almost impossible to work with without smelting
- almost always impure
**** Smelting
***** Bronze
- mix of tin and copper
- really good for weapons
- melt pretty easily
- can pour into any shape you want
- mass production of weapons
- every sword, helmet is the same, and the same quality
- first thing made that you do not find in nature on a molecular level
***** Iron
- 15000BC China
*** Egyptians
- surrounded by large desert, so protected from other humans
- nile river is unique
  + good for transportation
    - water current South -> North
    - wind North -> South
- invented sails for boats, 3000BC
- predictable flooding, unlike the area the Sumerians were in
  + new layer of topsoil each time, acts like fertilizer
  + huge surplus of food
  + Nilometer
    - wooden stick to measure height
    - based on observation of stars they could predict flooding and surplus of food
    - Pharaoh kept secret
    - this knowlege kept secret from commoners (farmers)
    - knew when solar eclipse is happening, used religion to scare the peasants
  + good observers of the sky
    - did NOT come up with astronomy
- canals for farming, and store water for farming
  + sumerians had canals, but did not store water
  + water storage allowed for 2 harvests
- Menes first Pharaoh
  3200BC
- control of centralized granary (money 1500BC)
- largest surplus of food

**** Was Egyptian civilization as technologically advanced as is generally believed?
Probably not.
- preoccupied with afterlife
  + engineering scemes just produced gigantic tombs
- could have done so much more with the resources spent
- borrowd most technology from Sumerians
- didn't really do scientific investigation
- good observation though
- not as influential, because of religion
- religion dictated that most resources were spent on tombs instead of public buildings or advancing society

**** Money


**** Pyramids
food surplus funneled into building pyramids
- large tombs
- not accessible to public
- progression of design
- starts with step pyramids
- made by paid workers
- when the nile is flooded, farmers have no work
- Pharaos pays farmers to work -> they don't overthrow the government because they're busy
- wealth was spent on building gigantic tombs. Resources could have been spent better on more cool things

***** Mastaba
3100BC
- tombs
- bunker like structures
***** Step Pyramids
- created by Imhotep 2650BC minister of Djoser
- basically mastabas stacked on top of each other

- fill the gaps in the step pyramid to make the smooth ramp
- built over 20 years by 20000 men
- over 2.4 million blocks of stone, each block over 1500kg (1 ton each)
- blocks are prefabricated, transported by water
**** Mummification
- did not do it for science (anatomy)
- it was all about immortality
  + stop decomposition of body by removing internal organs
  + dehydration
  + organs were destroyed before they were studied
  + brain liquidized by bronze hook, discarded
    - did not think the brain had any purpose
    - they thought the heart was the important thing
  + all internal organs removed except for heart
  + internal organs dissolved or destroyed within body before they could be examined
  + duty for these people was to prepare the body for the afterlife, no time to study anatomy
*** Hyksos
1700BC
Nomadic people
- Captured Egypt, got rid of Pharaos
- Egyptians eventually recaptured, and put Pharaos back in charge, but
- Egypt never the same. They thought different, never felt powerful as a society again
- Captured again by Alexandria and then the Romans

*** Irrigation
- mathematics
- engineering
- labour organization
- measurement system
- centralized project management
*** Greeks
- first to separate divine from natural
- scienctific method, new technologies

* Applied Science
** Ancient Greece
- because their religion was different, they came up with modern science
- first to apply scientific theory to technological ends
  + warfare, lots of Romans died
** Components needed for science
1. free time
2. record keeping
3. standardized measurement system
4. mathematics

Sumerians, Babylonians and Egyptians had these components, but no science. Why?
- because of religion
- people powerless in their relations with gods
- no public communication networks (like old school internet)

*** Religion
Greek mythology

Greeks are different because in their world, they interacted with gods
- Greek mythology has humans interacting with gods
  + humans had sex with gods
- separation of divine from natural phenomena
  + tried to explain/understand how the world works without the intervention of gods
- Hesiod
  8th century BC
  + gathered greek myths and combined it into what we now know as Greek Mythology
  + trigger for modern science
  + argued that there are all these different gods around -- sea, lightning, well-being, etc
    - we as humans can understand the workings of the universe without divine intervention
  + influenced pre-Socratics
    - Miletus c. 600BC

*** Agora
- city square where you could say anything you wanted
  + I believe that....
- people could criticize government
  + ex: Socrates constantly complained about the government
- public discourse


*** Miletus
- c. 600BC
  1. Food surplus
  2. spare time
  3. writing
  4. mathematics
  5. time keeping
====================================
     new to Acient Greece
====================================
  6. separation of divine from natural
  7. unrestricted communication networks

     This all came together

*** Law system: Tangible Evidence
- open presentation of evidence
- prove guilt by showing evidence
- prove something beyond doubt -- this is how we do science today
** Philosophers
1. Thales of Miletus
   + c.624-574BC
   + rejected divine intervention
   + first philosopher/scientist
     - used mathematics to try and explain things
   + we don't know much about him, first one known in the record
   + figured out how to find the height of pyramids by their shadow
     - good at geometry
   + first Greek astronomer who could predict solar eclipses
   + found electricity by charging amber by rubbing it
     - no evidence to suggest this though but the important thing is that the Greeks knew about static electricity
   + died by falling into a well while observing the sky
   +
2. Alexander of Miletus
   - c611-546BC
   - student of Thales (above)
   - made a first world map
     + wasn't that great but impressive for the time
   - evolution theory
     + he thought that humans originally evolved from fish
     + latest modern theory today says that land animals originated from the ocean
   - for the first time, society (tried to) explain its origins without the divine
3. Pythagoras
   - argued that fundamental reality can be understood and studied/expressed only by mathematics
   - argued that math is a universal language
   - one of the first Philosophers who tried to understand the universe (how planets move)
     + Hestia, a big fire in the centre of the universe, gives energy to everything else
     + Earth and Sun orbit Hestia
     + Counter-Earth shields Earth from Hestia's fire
     + outer sphere of fixed stars
       =====================================
       up to this point, Scientists and Philosophers were the same

       now it starts to split
       =======================================
4. Parmenides of Elea
   - c.515BC
   - science based on observation versus philosopher
   - part of stoic movement
     + nothing really matters

     + your senses are just an illusion
5. Zeno of Elea
   - c490-425bc
   - follower of Parmenides, also a stoic
   - if you believe that there is no change, motion is not possible
     + motion is not possible without change

6. Plato
   - 427-347BC
   - student of Socrates
   - interested in the sky, fundamental reality
     + in between stoic and not being stoic
   - true knowledge cannot be gained through senses
     + our senses are unreliable
     + allegory of the cave
       - in order to get true knowledge, we have to remove the chains and limitations of standard human perception
       - people chained and only seeing a wall with shadows have no idea of the world beyond those shadows.
         + break the chains, for example, like how the microscope allowed us to find bacteria and discover something new

   - sphere is a perfect form with no impurities
     + 388BC created first school: Academy
     + teaching was entirely dialogue, discussion between student and teacher
     + kind of like a gymnasium
       - swimming pool
       - work out equipment
       - lots of parties
         + get drunk
         + orgies
       - only for men
         + believed women should not be involved in philisophocal and scientific endeavours
           - women viewed as less than men
         + highest degree of love was believed to be between 2 men

7. Empedocles
   An empericist
   + c. 492-432BC
   + believed that whatever you experience/discover in science can only be done through your senses, through emperical evidence
   + used an experimentatal approach like modern science
   + first volcanologist
     - wanted to find how hot volcano is
     - jumped in and died

8. Democritus
   - c.460-370BC
   - experimental approach
   - reductionism
     + breaking things down into the smallest components possible
       - took students to beach
       - told student to hit sand grain with rock many times until you couldn't see anything
         + there is something still there, a small particle we can't see
         + theory of the atom
           - everything is made from atoms
           - things are created when atoms come together
           - nothing exists exept atoms and empty space
9. Aristotle
   - 384-322BC
   - student of plato
   - most influential
   - proved Earth is a sphere
     + lunar eclipse earch cast a circular shadow
   - thought Earth was at the center of the universe
   - introduced physics
     + concept of resistance
     + the greater the resistance the slower the body moves
     + no motion without a mover being in contact with an object
       - this is what he thought, obviously wrong today
       - could not explain how an arrow flies with no one touching it in midair
   - "father of biology"
     + dissected animals
     + vivissected (cut while still alive)
     + classified species
   - created a school:  Lyceum 335BC
     + still get drunk and have orgies lilke in Academy
     + education started to evolve into technology

     Towards end of his live moved away from empirical to logic

     Senses leads to observation which goes to your mind
     mind leads to logic
     logic leads to knowledge

     A 3-legged dog is not a dog, because dogs have 4 legs

10. Aristarchus
    - 300BC
    - heliocentric model of universe

*** Lyceum
- Aristotle
- a *system/technology* used to create perfect citizens/leaders
- failed miserablly
- a student was Alexander the great (turned around and captured Athens lol)

** Women
note: even though women couldn't do philosophy or science, they were allowed to be doctors
In the Greek world, it's the first time women were allowed to practice medicine

Agnodike did not exit

- Iatra (doctor)
- Maia (midwife) -- there were midwives in other societies
- Male doctors could not deal with female patients, they kept dying
- female doctors only worked on female patients

      - navy retreats away from catapults
    - death ray
      + one more surprise
      + their ships went ablaze
      + big concave mirror, reflect sun ray
        - set ships on one by one

212 BC Celebration of victories over Romans
Romans have been at it over like 2 years, and Archimedes has a new terror weapon each time
- but this time, there was a traitor who opened up the gate while they were partying, and then they got completely decimated by the Romans
- Archimedes did not bathe, he was very smelly, because science comes first
- when Syracuse was taken, they ordered Archimedes to live, because they were amazed with his genius
- when they found him, he just kind of refused to go because he was doing math in the middle of armageddon
  + soldier finally got fed up and just offed him lol
- all of his writings and inventions captured and kept intact by romans

  + they had a lot of people to put to work, steam engine would mean less work to do
  + regarded the contraptions as toys
  + Heron not interested in selling/commercializing his inventions
* Engineering under Roman Empire
- our law system is based on Romans
- our language is based on Latin

- 753BC Rome founded by Romulus
- lasted about 500 years
- Roman Republic 510 - 44BC
  + ended when Julius Caesar came to power in 44BC
- Roman Empire 44BC - 500AD (West), 1453AD (East)
  + ended when Constantiniple was taken in 1453AD
- Roman empire split in 2 halves: east and west
- wealthy people sponsored public projects
  + anyone could visit public buildings, not restricted to wealthy,  unlike Egypt, Sumerians
  + resources collectively spent on public structures instead of on stuff restricted to certain groups
    of people
- population over 1 million
  + pollution
  + housing crisis
  + crime
  + same issues as today

** Army Structure
- used Phalanx-Greek system initially
  + long spears
  + lower spears, enemy charges, and they impale themselves
  + avoids hand-to-hand combat which is heavily demanding on the human body
  + basically, whoever attacks first loses
  + alexander was successful because he cut them in half which made it more maneuverable
  + Romans copied too
- 3000BC they abandon Phalanx
***  Roman 3 line system
   actually made of 4 lines
   4200 men, 1 "Legion"
1. 1200 Velites (first line)
   - big shields
   - block long range weapons, until the enemy runs out and they are forced to charge
   - no weapons, they run and hide behind main troops when enemy charges
   - youngest men, Romans didn't really count them as troops
2. 1st line: 1200 Hastati
   - first assault
   - combine shortened spear (compared with Greeks) with full body shield
   - only stick pokes out
   - tough, well trained
   - weapons can't really penetrate shield, and spear would kill you before hand-to-hand combat
3. 2nd line: Principes
   - strongest
     + big, experienced, muscled
4. 3rd line: 600 Triarii
   - oldest/veterans of wars
5. the 3 line system means the troops didn't get tired
   a. continuous supply of troops
   b. join them or get destroyed
   c. other people didn't have as many allies, couldn't use same tactic
*** New system for recruitment
- before 107BC Only the wealthy were in army
  + ususally your daddy is a General
  + you're in the army for only as long as the war lasts
  + gain fame, prestige, loot
  + when war happens, importand government people are gone
- landless/poor paid career
  + no longer restricted to wealthly
  + a nobody could become prestigious, also get loot, earn higher salaries as they climb the ladder
  + retirement package
    - after 25 years, you can retire, and the government gives you land and income
    - not many people survive 25 years in the Legion
      + that is, until there were no more allies to make
      + start running out of land
      + some army rebels against government to get their retirement package
    - romans expand rapidly
    -
** Forts
- Romans liked standardization
- every fort had:
  + running water
  + plumbing
  + public/private toilets
  + baths
  + heating system
    - forced air, like today, modern era
**** Castra
- stone forts
- special engineering units
- educate and hire engineers
  + sumerians originally had engineers, but no standardization
- each Legion had engineers paid by government which did construction of forts
- evolved into medieval castles (castles copied their design)

** Communication revolution
- like ancient day amazon, ebay, gmail
