* Introduction
- don't need to know dates from textbook
- know major ideas, concepts, events, ideas, approaches
- Pay attenton to stuff not discussed in lectures
* Early Technologies
- Lecture 2

  What is technology? Cars, rockets, airplanes, computers are products of systems
  - technology :: a system that leads to creation of predetermined products (large scale, standardized)
    + a system which leads to usually mass production of objects of a predetermined pattern
    ex: Education is a technology, and the product is you

*** Africa
- c. - circa 2.5 million years ago
- prehistoric period before 3200BC
**** The Great Rift Valley
- birth of technology
***** Oldowan tools (flake tools)
2.5 mil. - 1.5 mil.
- first example of technology
- not very standardized
- take hard stone, hit softer stone, and you get a flake that chips off that you can use as a tool
- not as precise as later stone tools
- quartz, basalt, obsidian
- they didn't use flint (which is ideal) because it was not around
- created by <<<Australopitchecus>>> (<<<Lucy>>>)
    + bipedal, but not walking upright
***** Acheulean tools (core tools)
1.5 mil - 100000
- core tools
- predetermined pattern, they all look fairly similar
- new method of production
- reverse process of flake tool
  + big stone carved into tool, flakes discarded
- <<<Homo Erectus>>> (<<<Turkana Boy>>>)
  + bipedal
  + closer to us (Homo Sapiens)
- large stone tools
- made of flint
  + really sharp, we still use it for surguries today
- flint hand axe
- makes hunting possible
  + can kill animal
  + more meat
***** Fire
- c. 1 million
   cannot make fire, can move it into caves though
- stone tools
- more meat
- new proteins -> bigger brains
  + c. 100000 Homo Sapiens
  + bigger brains -> abstract thinking -> new technologies
  + using technologies to survive, get food, and not be eaten by other animals hunting humans
*** Agriculture
**** Mesopotamia
- c. 10000BC
- at the time, it was like a paradise
  + ice age, cold, lack of food, have to constantly walk and move
  + lots of plants, things green and growing, lots of food in Mesopotamia
  +
    - domestication
    - animals got used to human garbage
    -
**** Domestication of animals
7500BC
- animals got attracted to human garbage, start hanging around
- sheep, goat, pig, cow
- *shift from "eat when you catch it asap" -> 'save the best for the next year'*
  + surplus of food 2% -- first time!!
**** Surplus of food
can focus on things other than survival
- Division of labor
  + preserving extra food
- Specialization
- Political elite
  + someone in charge of food
- First towns
  + mud huts
  + large centres of human activities

*** Catalhoyuk
- c 7000BC
- one of the older towns
- there were others, but they didn't survive
- standardization of
  + housing
  + construction
    - mud bricks, same material
  + ruled by those who controlled food surpluses
- wealth measured by how much surplus food you have (no money)
- interconnected houses
  + save building materials by building less walls
- population about 6000
- furnaces
- beds have dead ancestors below, they slept with the dead
- kitchen, grinding wheel, ladders
- fairly modern

*** Plow
4000BC
- first civilization, cities, monumental buildings
- agriculture -> first civilization
- large surplus of food
- made science possible
- it created the possibility for spare time because of surplus of food
- people can sit down and think 'why'

*** Sumerians
- first pyramids
- houses made of mudbricks, had warfare, not much left
- Egyptians used their technology, they made pyramids first (ziggurats)
- invented lawyers
- plow
- government
- religion
- math
- writing
- time
- first paid army
- metallurgy
- 1900BC captured by Amorites (Babylonians)
- *iteraction/trade with Egyptians*

**** Uruk
- c. 4000BC
- population 50000
- bureaucracy, army
- standardization of government buildings
- permanent construction with stone
- roads
**** Religion
- every city has a ziggurat, which is a temple
- each city protected by a deity, usually female
- bring donations, surplus of food, animals
- priests keep a count of dues provided to temple
- records kept for who donated what, needed a better system (writing)
**** Writing
3200BC
- clay tablets
- cuneiform (wedge shaped)
  + first written language we know of
- issuing receipts for trade

***** Alphabet
3000BC
- Epic of Gilgamesh
  2000BC
  + first known story

  1700BC
  + first known legal/law system
  + what is the punishment for doing certain things
**** Math
**** Clock
- modern concept of time
- calendar
**** Transportation
- people want to trade with Sumarians because they had a lot of wealth
***** Wheel
**** Army
- weapons
- armour
- metallurgy (making weapons and armour out of metal)
**** Gold
6000BC
- visible
- soft
- shaped by pounding
**** Copper
5000BC
- harder than gold, better for weapons
**** Silver
4000BC
- harder, more durable
- almost impossible to work with without smelting
- almost always impure
**** Smelting
***** Bronze
- mix of tin and copper
- really good for weapons
- melt pretty easily
- can pour into any shape you want
- mass production of weapons
- every sword, helmet is the same, and the same quality
- first thing made that you do not find in nature on a molecular level
***** Iron
- 15000BC China
*** Egyptians
- surrounded by large desert, so protected from other humans
- nile river is unique
  + good for transportation
    - water current South -> North
    - wind North -> South
- invented sails for boats, 3000BC
- predictable flooding, unlike the area the Sumerians were in
  + new layer of topsoil each time, acts like fertilizer
  + huge surplus of food
  + Nilometer
    - wooden stick to measure height
    - based on observation of stars they could predict flooding and surplus of food
    - Pharaoh kept secret
    - this knowlege kept secret from commoners (farmers)
    - knew when solar eclipse is happening, used religion to scare the peasants
  + good observers of the sky
    - did NOT come up with astronomy
- canals for farming, and store water for farming
  + sumerians had canals, but did not store water
  + water storage allowed for 2 harvests
- Menes first Pharaoh
  3200BC
- control of centralized granary (money 1500BC)
- largest surplus of food

**** Was Egyptian civilization as technologically advanced as is generally believed?
Probably not.
- preoccupied with afterlife
  + engineering scemes just produced gigantic tombs
- could have done so much more with the resources spent
- borrowd most technology from Sumerians
- didn't really do scientific investigation
- good observation though
- not as influential, because of religion
- religion dictated that most resources were spent on tombs instead of public buildings or advancing society

**** Money


**** Pyramids
food surplus funneled into building pyramids
- large tombs
- not accessible to public
- progression of design
- starts with step pyramids
- made by paid workers
- when the nile is flooded, farmers have no work
- Pharaos pays farmers to work -> they don't overthrow the government because they're busy
- wealth was spent on building gigantic tombs. Resources could have been spent better on more cool things

***** Mastaba
3100BC
- tombs
- bunker like structures
***** Step Pyramids
- created by Imhotep 2650BC minister of Djoser
- basically mastabas stacked on top of each other

- fill the gaps in the step pyramid to make the smooth ramp
- built over 20 years by 20000 men
- over 2.4 million blocks of stone, each block over 1500kg (1 ton each)
- blocks are prefabricated, transported by water
**** Mummification
- did not do it for science (anatomy)
- it was all about immortality
  + stop decomposition of body by removing internal organs
  + dehydration
  + organs were destroyed before they were studied
  + brain liquidized by bronze hook, discarded
    - did not think the brain had any purpose
    - they thought the heart was the important thing
  + all internal organs removed except for heart
  + internal organs dissolved or destroyed within body before they could be examined
  + duty for these people was to prepare the body for the afterlife, no time to study anatomy
*** Hyksos
1700BC
Nomadic people
- Captured Egypt, got rid of Pharaos
- Egyptians eventually recaptured, and put Pharaos back in charge, but
- Egypt never the same. They thought different, never felt powerful as a society again
- Captured again by Alexandria and then the Romans

*** Irrigation
- mathematics
- engineering
- labour organization
- measurement system
- centralized project management
*** Greeks
- first to separate divine from natural
- scienctific method, new technologies

* Applied Science
** Ancient Greece
- because their religion was different, they came up with modern science
- first to apply scientific theory to technological ends
  + warfare, lots of Romans died
** Components needed for science
1. free time
2. record keeping
3. standardized measurement system
4. mathematics

Sumerians, Babylonians and Egyptians had these components, but no science. Why?
- because of religion
- people powerless in their relations with gods
- no public communication networks (like old school internet)

*** Religion
Greek mythology

Greeks are different because in their world, they interacted with gods
- Greek mythology has humans interacting with gods
  + humans had sex with gods
- separation of divine from natural phenomena
  + tried to explain/understand how the world works without the intervention of gods
- Hesiod
  8th century BC
  + gathered greek myths and combined it into what we now know as Greek Mythology
  + trigger for modern science
  + argued that there are all these different gods around -- sea, lightning, well-being, etc
    - we as humans can understand the workings of the universe without divine intervention
  + influenced pre-Socratics
    - Miletus c. 600BC

*** Agora
- city square where you could say anything you wanted
  + I believe that....
- people could criticize government
  + ex: Socrates constantly complained about the government
- public discourse


*** Miletus
- c. 600BC
  1. Food surplus
  2. spare time
  3. writing
  4. mathematics
  5. time keeping
====================================
     new to Acient Greece
====================================
  6. separation of divine from natural
  7. unrestricted communication networks

     This all came together

*** Law system: Tangible Evidence
- open presentation of evidence
- prove guilt by showing evidence
- prove something beyond doubt -- this is how we do science today
** Philosophers
1. Thales of Miletus
   + c.624-574BC
   + rejected divine intervention
   + first philosopher/scientist
     - used mathematics to try and explain things
   + we don't know much about him, first one known in the record
   + figured out how to find the height of pyramids by their shadow
     - good at geometry
   + first Greek astronomer who could predict solar eclipses
   + found electricity by charging amber by rubbing it
     - no evidence to suggest this though but the important thing is that the Greeks knew about static electricity
   + died by falling into a well while observing the sky
   +
2. Alexander of Miletus
   - c611-546BC
   - student of Thales (above)
   - made a first world map
     + wasn't that great but impressive for the time
   - evolution theory
     + he thought that humans originally evolved from fish
     + latest modern theory today says that land animals originated from the ocean
   - for the first time, society (tried to) explain its origins without the divine
3. Pythagoras
   - argued that fundamental reality can be understood and studied/expressed only by mathematics
   - argued that math is a universal language
   - one of the first Philosophers who tried to understand the universe (how planets move)
     + Hestia, a big fire in the centre of the universe, gives energy to everything else
     + Earth and Sun orbit Hestia
     + Counter-Earth shields Earth from Hestia's fire
     + outer sphere of fixed stars
       =====================================
       up to this point, Scientists and Philosophers were the same

       now it starts to split
       =======================================
4. Parmenides of Elea
   - c.515BC
   - science based on observation versus philosopher
   - part of stoic movement
     + nothing really matters

     + your senses are just an illusion
5. Zeno of Elea
   - c490-425bc
   - follower of Parmenides, also a stoic
   - if you believe that there is no change, motion is not possible
     + motion is not possible without change

6. Plato
   - 427-347BC
   - student of Socrates
   - interested in the sky, fundamental reality
     + in between stoic and not being stoic
   - true knowledge cannot be gained through senses
     + our senses are unreliable
     + allegory of the cave
       - in order to get true knowledge, we have to remove the chains and limitations of standard human perception
       - people chained and only seeing a wall with shadows have no idea of the world beyond those shadows.
         + break the chains, for example, like how the microscope allowed us to find bacteria and discover something new

   - sphere is a perfect form with no impurities
     + 388BC created first school: Academy
     + teaching was entirely dialogue, discussion between student and teacher
     + kind of like a gymnasium
       - swimming pool
       - work out equipment
       - lots of parties
         + get drunk
         + orgies
       - only for men
         + believed women should not be involved in philisophocal and scientific endeavours
           - women viewed as less than men
         + highest degree of love was believed to be between 2 men

7. Empedocles
   An empericist
   + c. 492-432BC
   + believed that whatever you experience/discover in science can only be done through your senses, through emperical evidence
   + used an experimentatal approach like modern science
   + first volcanologist
     - wanted to find how hot volcano is
     - jumped in and died

8. Democritus
   - c.460-370BC
   - experimental approach
   - reductionism
     + breaking things down into the smallest components possible
       - took students to beach
       - told student to hit sand grain with rock many times until you couldn't see anything
         + there is something still there, a small particle we can't see
         + theory of the atom
           - everything is made from atoms
           - things are created when atoms come together
           - nothing exists exept atoms and empty space
9. Aristotle
   - 384-322BC
   - student of plato
   - most influential
   - proved Earth is a sphere
     + lunar eclipse earch cast a circular shadow
   - thought Earth was at the center of the universe
   - introduced physics
     + concept of resistance
     + the greater the resistance the slower the body moves
     + no motion without a mover being in contact with an object
       - this is what he thought, obviously wrong today
       - could not explain how an arrow flies with no one touching it in midair
   - "father of biology"
     + dissected animals
     + vivissected (cut while still alive)
     + classified species
   - created a school:  Lyceum 335BC
     + still get drunk and have orgies lilke in Academy
     + education started to evolve into technology

     Towards end of his live moved away from empirical to logic

     Senses leads to observation which goes to your mind
     mind leads to logic
     logic leads to knowledge

     A 3-legged dog is not a dog, because dogs have 4 legs

10. Aristarchus
    - 300BC
    - heliocentric model of universe

*** Lyceum
- Aristotle
- a *system/technology* used to create perfect citizens/leaders
- failed miserablly
- a student was Alexander the great (turned around and captured Athens lol)

** Women
note: even though women couldn't do philosophy or science, they were allowed to be doctors
In the Greek world, it's the first time women were allowed to practice medicine

Agnodike did not exit

- Iatra (doctor)
- Maia (midwife) -- there were midwives in other societies
- Male doctors could not deal with female patients, they kept dying
- female doctors only worked on female patients

      - navy retreats away from catapults
    - death ray
      + one more surprise
      + their ships went ablaze
      + big concave mirror, reflect sun ray
        - set ships on one by one

212 BC Celebration of victories over Romans
Romans have been at it over like 2 years, and Archimedes has a new terror weapon each time
- but this time, there was a traitor who opened up the gate while they were partying, and then they got completely decimated by the Romans
- Archimedes did not bathe, he was very smelly, because science comes first
- when Syracuse was taken, they ordered Archimedes to live, because they were amazed with his genius
- when they found him, he just kind of refused to go because he was doing math in the middle of armageddon
  + soldier finally got fed up and just offed him lol
- all of his writings and inventions captured and kept intact by romans

  + they had a lot of people to put to work, steam engine would mean less work to do
  + regarded the contraptions as toys
  + Heron not interested in selling/commercializing his inventions
* Engineering under Roman Empire
- our law system is based on Romans
- our language is based on Latin

- 753BC Rome founded by Romulus
- lasted about 500 years
- Roman Republic 510 - 44BC
  + ended when Julius Caesar came to power in 44BC
- Roman Empire 44BC - 500AD (West), 1453AD (East)
  + ended when Constantiniple was taken in 1453AD
- Roman empire split in 2 halves: east and west
- wealthy people sponsored public projects
  + anyone could visit public buildings, not restricted to wealthy,  unlike Egypt, Sumerians
  + resources collectively spent on public structures instead of on stuff restricted to certain groups
    of people
- population over 1 million
  + pollution
  + housing crisis
  + crime
  + same issues as today

** Army Structure
- used Phalanx-Greek system initially
  + long spears
  + lower spears, enemy charges, and they impale themselves
  + avoids hand-to-hand combat which is heavily demanding on the human body
  + basically, whoever attacks first loses
  + alexander was successful because he cut them in half which made it more maneuverable
  + Romans copied too
- 3000BC they abandon Phalanx
***  Roman 3 line system
   actually made of 4 lines
   4200 men, 1 "Legion"
1. 1200 Velites (first line)
   - big shields
   - block long range weapons, until the enemy runs out and they are forced to charge
   - no weapons, they run and hide behind main troops when enemy charges
   - youngest men, Romans didn't really count them as troops
2. 1st line: 1200 Hastati
   - first assault
   - combine shortened spear (compared with Greeks) with full body shield
   - only stick pokes out
   - tough, well trained
   - weapons can't really penetrate shield, and spear would kill you before hand-to-hand combat
3. 2nd line: Principes
   - strongest
     + big, experienced, muscled
4. 3rd line: 600 Triarii
   - oldest/veterans of wars
5. the 3 line system means the troops didn't get tired
   a. continuous supply of troops
   b. join them or get destroyed
   c. other people didn't have as many allies, couldn't use same tactic
*** New system for recruitment
- before 107BC Only the wealthy were in army
  + ususally your daddy is a General
  + you're in the army for only as long as the war lasts
  + gain fame, prestige, loot
  + when war happens, importand government people are gone
- landless/poor paid career
  + no longer restricted to wealthly
  + a nobody could become prestigious, also get loot, earn higher salaries as they climb the ladder
  + retirement package
    - after 25 years, you can retire, and the government gives you land and income
    - not many people survive 25 years in the Legion
      + that is, until there were no more allies to make
      + start running out of land
      + some army rebels against government to get their retirement package
    - romans expand rapidly
    -
** Forts
- Romans liked standardization
- every fort had:
  + running water
  + plumbing
  + public/private toilets
  + baths
  + heating system
    - forced air, like today, modern era
**** Castra
- stone forts
- special engineering units
- educate and hire engineers
  + sumerians originally had engineers, but no standardization
- each Legion had engineers paid by government which did construction of forts
- evolved into medieval castles (castles copied their design)

** Communication revolution
- like ancient day amazon, ebay, gmail
- can write letter, request items
  + everybody had access, not just for wealthy
- even women and slaves were literate
*** Vindolanda letters
- c97-103AD
- women, slaves, foreigners, everyone could participate
- affordable and *standardized*
- latin
- flat piece of wood (papyrus was expensive)
- celebrated birthdays, new years, etc
** Roads
- all roads lead to Rome
- built to last
- labour intensive
- building roads was a way to control people
  + like the pyramids, putting people to work means less rebellions
  + kept soldiers occupied
  + roads built by army NOT slaves
- how to build road
  1. send engineers
     - groma used to get right angles
     - laid down straight road plan
     - dig a ditch 1.5m deep (Fossa)
  2. Pavimentum
     - compacted sand or dry earth
  3. Statumen
     - crushed rock
  4. Rudus
     - cemented large gravel
  5. Nucleus
     - cemented sand and small gravel
     - like modern concrete
  6. Summum dorsum
     - large stone slabs
     - the road surface
     - carved rocks
     - they were curved outward
       + gets water away from road, into ditches
  7. Parallel drainage ditch
- milestones
  + every 1.5km (1 Roman mile)
**** Infrastructure
- inns
- hotels
- restaurants
- changing stations
- "gas stations": hay for horses to eat, place to rest
**** Millarium Aureum
- golden milestone
- like ancient google earch
- would tell you what roads to take, where to turn, etc
  + nearby establishments
  + hotels, accommodations
  + what boats to take

** Development of modern city Rome
*** Cement
- lime
- volcanic ash
- water
- instead of sand, they used volcanic ash which turned out to make the cement strong
- then they would hang marble off of the cement using bronze hooks
- they used the greek Doric style
- Ionic style also, almost any government building has the Ionic pillars
- Corinthian style is the most elaborate style
  + most expensive to produce
- columns built in sections on a lathe
  + joined together with shaft though center hole
*** Building a building
- funded by magistrates
- has to be approved by senate (even an emporer)
- building is a provilege
- if you're not an emporer, you couldn't build a private house or villa
  + can build temple
  + theatre
  + library
  + bathhouses
  + anything public
- this is a good way to show off personal wealth
- you get to put your name on the structure
  + just like telus world of science, rogers place, etc
*** Flavian Theater
- known as colosseum today
- built by Vespasian (Flavia family)
- big building testifying prestige and strength of emporer
  + big buildings == big pp
**** Games
- staged.
- people were trained to fight the animals
  + expensive to train
- gladiators expensive don't want to lose them too often
- Weird sex practices were demonstrated
  + enternainment
  + recreate bizarre sex practices from Greek mythology for examples
  + e.g. sex with animals
  + some women died because they did it with large animals
***** Water games
- flood coliseum
- recreate 1:1 scale naval battles
- largest shows ever
- we have no idea how they did it
- no idea how the building could take all the water pressure
***** Social Control
panem et circenses

+ bread and circuses
+ if you provide your public with free food and entertainment, people love you
  + take any one away, and people get upset and turn against the government
+ when the games were on, you didn't go to work because it's a civic day
+ some of these games went for a long time, (paid holiday by government)
  - ex: largest show- Trajan 107AD, 123 days
  - at the height of the Roman empire, sometimes you watched the games more than working and got paid!
  - thumbs up means finish off somebody
  - thumbs down means put sword away
  - backwards to how we interpret it today
*** Circus Maximus
- largest public structure probably ever
- 250-500000 spectators
- chariot racing
*** Water
- running water (aquaducts) first to use arches and the water system on massive scale
- toilets, baths, underground sewers
- Jereusalem also had these, but only for the priests. The cities didn't have them
- first to have public toilets
  + didn't happen again until 1851
- instant removal of pollution from under you
- paper was expensive, so they used sponges on a stick which were then put in a bucket and reused

**** Cloaca Maxima
large sewer system
- sewer designs today are basically the same
- main tunnel to deliver all the waste water, which then dumps into a ruver
- nowadays, we have water treatment
**** Plumbing
Stinking Venus
- if you had issues, you didn't call a plumber
- you go to Venus Cloacina in a temple
- pour wine into head, throw coins, there's a pipe which goes directly to Cloaca Maxima which stinks
** Science and Natural philosophy
200BC (after Syracuse) Greek philosophy/science entered Rome
*** Posidonius
135-51BC
- Roman scientist
- correct theory of ocean tides
  + related to the moon
  + he didn't understand gravity, but knew tides were correlated to the moon
*** Pliny the elder
24-79AD
- system for collecting information
- first encyclopedia of information
- kind of like ancient Wikipedia
  + mixture of fiction, information, misinformation, and truth
  + access to information, but not necessarily to truth
  + easy to look up information, cross reference
*** Claudius Ptolemy
127-148AD
- lived in Alexandria
- nothing to do with Ptolemy kings or Cleopatra (over a century ago at this point)
- the Almagest
**** the Almagest
- first mathematical model of cosmos
- got it wrong, but first to try
** End of Rome
300-500AD
- Christianity - 300AD new capital Constantinople
  + roman emporer Constantine
  + saw fish as Christian symbol
  + thought Christian gods supported him
  + ordered that everyone in the Roman empire be Christians
  + funny because they used to kill Christians a lot
  + split between east and west because they couldn't decide on one type of Christianity
  + Constantine wanted to move away from Rome because it was filled with Pagean temples
  + made a new capital Contantinople
  + marble burned and turned into lime
- not captured, collapsed on its own
  + government not there to pay for upkeep of infrastructure
  + by 500AD Rome is deserted
- no one was left to pay for upkeep of roads, sewer system, etc
- had to do with religion
- 410AD 'Sack' of Rome by Visigoths
  + this is a myth, no fighting
  + they just kind of marched in and there was nothing of value so they smashed stuff
  + found bronze hooks
    - bronze is expensive, so they demolished stuff to collect bronze
- Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)
  + survived until end of medieval period 1453
  + new technology, came from Ancient China
  + pigs used as terror weapon
* Chinese and European Connection
** Chinese technologies and Europeans
- at the time China most technologically advanced, but not much happened like in Alexandria
- the Chinese never really used all the advanced technologies they had/invented, unlike when the Europeans got a hold of it
  + because of religion and government
  + they could've conquered the world, had an industrial revolution
  + had it all, and said no to technological progress
    - because government did not want change
    - they understood that new technology comes with social responsibilities and change

*** Compass
- basically a bowl with water, cork, and a needle on a cork
- they used the compass to make political decisions (who to vote for)
  + not for navigation
- Europeans used compass to navigate, conquer world
  + while Columbus was sailing, the Chinese made huge vessels
- Columbus's ship looks like a rowboat in comparison
- the Chinese never really ventured far
- concluded that basically everyone else is back in the stone age
  - decided to isolate, protect what they have
  - build wall
  - emporer ordered destuction of ships
*** Elixir of Life (Black Powder)
- potassium nitrate
- charcoal
- sulfur
- supposed to give everlasting life
- when the water dried out, they accidentally found black powder
*** Black Powder
- initially used it for religious festivals, not for warfare
- lots of noise is good for getting rid of evil spirits
- eventually figured out that if you put black powder in a tube, seal one end, it flies
  + invention of rockets
  + still primarily for religious festivals
- When Europeans got hold of this technology, they made bigger rockets
  + weapons of mass destruction
*** Different approach to change
- government/religion/world view
- in the western world, we view change as good, growth of society
  + rapid change = good
- in China, rapid change = imbalance (bad)
  + they like equilibrium, everything in balance
  + probably a connection with the ying yang here
*** Pigs
- pig's urine (ammonia)
- combined with pig's droppings = potassium nitrate
- gunpowder 800AD China
- cannons 1320s AD - China
  + technology transfer - Mongols - Turks
*** Constantinople
- largest fortress at the time
- thick walls, believed to be impossible to destroy
- Christian capital in the middle of Islamic region
- Turks got cannons from Mongols who got it from Ancient China
  + used cannons to beseige Constantinople
  + broke walls
- conquered by new technology
*** Cannons
- no impact on battlefields
  + inaccurate
  + killed own crew more than enemy
    - cannon could fall apart and explode
  + only good for breaking down walls/castles
- changed social structures/towns
- cannons were not durable
- *medieval castles obsolete*
- instead of knights in armour, we move to need for books
- castles turn from fortresses to places with philosophy, science, not as much emphasis on thick walls
  + i.e. places for discourse
*** Need for books
- greek books from Alexandria
- Arabs basically rediscovered some of the texts back in 700s AD Iran
  + found original tests from the backup library of Alexandria
  + mathematics and technological innovations
    - almegist
  + mathematics didn't contradict their religion
  + translated to Arabic
  + Al-Mamun House of Wisdom 700s AD
    - survived until 1095AD
  + Alexandria books basically survived in the form of Arabic
- 1095AD Pope of Rome, Christianity largest political, social force in every aspect of life
*** Knights
- elite groups
- horses
- connected to kings and queens
- actually terrible, killed peasants for no good reason not like the heros in movies
- eventually turned against government because there was nothing better to do
- only job is to convert everyone to Christianity
- not many Pagans left (non Christians)
- lost their purpose
- not really organized, work as individuals
**** Crusade
- solution to knights causing problems
- send them to the end of the earth, hope they don't come back
***** First Crusade
1905
- the knights actually came back
- they successfuly recaptured Jereusalem
- they discovered books in Jerusalem
- books were extremely expensive, as in an entire village with the peasants included just for one book
- spoils of war - Arabic books which were the translations of the Greek texts
- Greek -> Translated to Arabic -> Translated to Latin
- a lot of Greek ideas did not go along with Christianity, so the Latin translations were modified
*** Thomas Aquinas
- 1255-1274AD
- by 1255AD Aristotelian teaching/philosophy
- Ptolemaic/Platinic cosmos part of Christian idology
- huge demand for books like the ones by Aristotle
- there were only a few copies available
- hand written copies not being produced fast enough
** Gutenberg, printing press, medieval revival of ancient knowledge
- how can the huge demand for books be met
- probably most important technological innovation
- from 0 books to 11 million in 50 years
- rediscovery of Greek and Roman knowledge
- development of sciences and new technologies
- social and political changes - scientific revolution
- leads to the Renaissance
- to make paper you need:
  1) Paper (white)
     - ancient China in 1st century AD
     - kept as a secret by China
     - in 11th century AD came to Europe
       + literally stolen from Chinese
       + captured ancient Chinese paper makers and tortured them
     - turns out making white paper is really expensive
       + made out of linen fibers
       + expensive to produce before 1347
       + too cold to grow linen
     - in 1357, black death
       + linen underwear turned into paper (from possessions of dead people)
     - huge spending (increase in wealth) from survivors
     - anyone who had money wanted to buy books
       + for knowledge
       + also status symbol
       + Bible most expensive book to own
     - Monks/scribes wiped out in 1347
       + almost all died because they spread the plague by collecting in churches and praying together
       + people responsible for making bibles wiped out
  2) Fast Drying ink
     - Reusable type
     - Press
       + Archimedes had a screw press to press wine and olive oil
       + present during medieval period unlike the others, which had to be acquired
- Gutenburg was a gold smith
- wanted to be wealthy
- realized that introduction of printing press and mass production of Bibles could make him wealthy
  + ultimately ended up homeless
  + died in poverty
    - got a loan from Fust to buy lots of Linen
    - Fust forged a different contract that stated that Gutenberg must pay back huge loan + interest before Gutenberg sells bibles
    - Fust comes with police and takes posession of everything he had, threw him out
  + he did not invent the printing press
  + he invented oil-based ink
    - nicer writing for books
  + new alloy of lead and tin
    - perfect for press, don't need a high temperature furnace, and tougher than wood, durable
- 1450 Gutenburg's printing press
  + diffusion of technologies from China
  + 1455 Gutenberg bible (42-line Bible)
  + best quality books around
  + every page looked the same
  + standardization
  + first mass produced books
  + China had printing press, and books but they did not mass produce them
    - Diamond Sutra
    - Chinese language more complex to print, latin alphabet had way fewer characters
  + Jikiji
    - movable metal type 1377AD Korea
*** Black death
- eliminated up to 50% of Europe's population wiped out
- but people's possessions are still there, like clothing
  + *underwear* made of linen
  + underwear was turned into paper
- also extra animals, horses, etc
- poor people who survived became wealthy
- survivors have lots of wealth
* Revolution in Time
** Time before machines
*** Sundials & Water Clocks
- invented by Sumerians
  + water clocks wre used by Alexandrian doctors to measure pulss
- can measure time indoors and at night (water clock)
*** Candle Clock
- water freezes at night in medieval Europs
- invented in China c500 AD
- works indoors, and at night
- designed to be an alarm clock
  + candle is pre-calibrated, each notch represents an hour
  + put a nail in the side
  + candle melts, and in time, nail will fall, make noise, and hopeflly you wake up
- expensive
- caused a lot of fires
*** Sand clock (hourglass)
- too expensive, rare
- only glass makers in Venice could make them
- not accurate, have to flip it
** Mechanical Clock
- Archimedes's clock did not survive
- Abdul-Abbas clock 800d (islamic scholars version of Archimedes's clock)
- Mechanical contraption mounted on white elephant
- basically a cuckoo clock, every hour a bird comes out to indicate passage of time
*** Escapement mechanism
- gear with directional notches and rod
- pulley and rope with weight attached
  + constant force on wheel
  + bar stops wheel from spinning out of control, bar releases wheel one notch at a time
  + weight now converted to precise time interval
*** Su Song Clock
- China 1094AD
- basically a gigantic mechanical computer
- looks like Archimedes planetaria
- movements of planets and passage of time
*** Monks - Roman Catholoc Church
- need to wake up and pray
- missing prayers = sin, big deal
- c1327 Monk Rickard of Wallingford
- reinvention of mechanical clock in medieval Europe
- alarm clock, had a bell
- every hour, the bell would ring
**** Astrarium
- 1364
- Giovanni de'Dondi
- mechanical computer
- Calendars, movement of planets
- universe represented as a machine for the first time in Medieval Europe
  + one missing component, something important to them

** Chronometer
- very precise, small fractions of a second
- leads to modern watch
*** John Harrison
- carpenter
- liked building clocks
- first clock (wood)
  + everything, gears, etc are wood
- his dream was to participate in the dream-Longitude prize

**** Longitude Prize
- 1714 (20,000 pounds, over 10M USD today)
- Lattitude was easy to tell (North-South)
  + declination
    - at noon, measure distance between horizon and sun
  + lots of fleets lost
- Longitude really hard to measure (East-West)
  + need precise timepiece
  + accurate within 1 second per day
  + most accurate modern mechanical clocks today (2020s) are only accurate within 6s per day
- Best clocks 1-20 minutes per day on land at the time, so this was basically impossible
  + pendulum doesn't work on sea


**** Marine clock (H1)
- 1736
- Harrison's first marine clock
- first time in human history where someone built a machine which can adapt to environmental conditions
- could adapt to changing tempurature, humidity, and still be accurate
  + springs expand/shrink
- he didn't get the prize :(
- the committee kept the clock, took the blueprints, only gave a small amount of money
**** H2
- 1741
- even more accurate then H1
- smaller
- adapts to the environment better
- same story
**** H3
- 1759
- same story again
-
**** First Watch (H4)
- 1761
- for the first time, able to measure seconds
- they actually evaluated this clock
- given to captain: James Cook
  + he confirmed the accuracy
  + secret report
  + too good, he argued that if they used the device, and their ship was captured, they'd lose the British Empire
  + suggests to hide it and never use it
- Harrison was told his clock is not accurate enough anymore
- too old, depressed, poor eyesight (77 years old), somehow still creates H5
**** H5
- 1770
- *most accurate timepiece until 1968*
- still portable, it's a watch
- sent it directly to the King of England
- King of England confirmed it only lost 4 seconds in 10 days
- (basically, they use starts to measure accuracy)
- King of England sent letter to the prize committee
  + says Harrison must be awarded
  + in the end, the committee changed the prize, and he was never awarded
  + King sent him a separate pension


**** Aftermath
- clocks lost, he died 5 years later
- 1927 discovered at Greenwich
- the clocks are still ticking today in Greenwich
*** Petek Phillipe Co.
- wrist watch 1868
- the more accurate a watch, the more valuable it was
  + not the case today in 2020s

**** Technological retrogression
- a $10 watch from walmart is way more accurate (at least 10x)
- a Petek Phillipe watch is obsolete, still costs $11M
- we no longer attach value to accuracy, but rather aesthetics and status symbol
*** Time Trials
- 1700s-1903 British
- best/expensive watches would compete
- British would produce most expensive, most accurate watches
- 1903 Switzerlands starts producing pocket watches
*** Swiss Watches
- mass production inexpensive
- British manufacturers refused
  + pocket watch was a status symbol
  + they did not want to mass produce to give commoners watches
- 1903-1968 spplied 80% of watches
- 1968 last time trial, Swiss won
  + Seiko quartz
    - electrical current makes quartz oscillate
  + 10 times more accurate than any mechanical watch
  + stopped producing because they thought it was ugly
    - production moves to Japan in only 1 year
    - then, to China
*** Atomic clock
- 1950s
- Cesium
- proves time travel is possible
  + if you have a record player playing, put 2 pocket watches,
  + one on outside of record
  + one on inner ring
  + can see that the watch on the outside of the circle is travelling faster than the other
  + Albert Einstein theory of relativity (time is relative)
  + Experiment: put 2 atomic clocks in different military aircraft
  + one flying in smaller radius, one in larger
  + atomic clocks proved that there was a difference in time between the aircraft
  + time changes based on relative speed of object
*** Impact of clocks
- the mechanical clock started a chain of events, changed the way that people think
- clocks were governed by completely mechanical principles
- maybe planets move because of some laws of motion, not because of some supernatural force

* Mechanical Universe
** Scientific Revolution
- Renaissance
- period of evolution of natural philosophy into modern science
- actually, it was a shift of how we look at the world around us
  - question of why the universe (Greek approach) works to how the universe works (mechanical philosophy)
*** What is science?
- in that time: Scientia means "knowledge", it was for gaining knowledge
- today: for profit, fame, war
*** What is art?
- s
*** Historiography
2 ways of looking at the past:
**** internal approach (old)
- scientists make discoveries without being influenced by social (external) factors
- indipendent inventor/inborn genius
- tl;dr you study the engineering approach, and ignore social factors
**** external (new approach)
- external social factors shape development of science/technology
- ignore engineering/scientific factors
- focus on social contexts
  - government
  - religion
  - etc
- no such thing as inborn genius
**** 4 theories of how modern science came to beach

***** Tomas Kuhn: The Structure of Scientific Revolution
- internal approach
- structuralist
- tried to find a mathematical formula/ rigid structure to figure out how science happens, how theories form
- concentrated on what happens with scientists in labs
- how scientific ideas come about
- no single revolution
- a bunch of small revolutions, i.e. *paradigm shifts*
  1. Established science
  2. Normal science (puzzle solving process)
  3. novelty/anomaly appears (something that could not be predicted)
     - cannot be explained by esablished science
  4. crisis in normal established science
  5. emergence of a new paradigm (revolution)
  6. new normal science
     - the cycle then repeats
***** Robert Merton (PhD thesis): Puritanism and the Rise of Modern Science
- external approach
- religion/external factors shaped scientific/technological progress (both positively or negatively)
- no one really considered this at the time
- Protestants used science to make profits
- Roman Catholics did not
- different approach to personal wealth
- scientific revolution only happened in Protestant countries because the Roman Catholics believed that god would make you poor and miserable if he loved you
- Protestants believed if god loved you, you'd be successful, wealthy
- tl;dr it's not a coincidence that the scientific/industrial revolution only happened in Protestant countries
***** Edgar Zilsel: The Social Origins of Modern Science
- external approach
- looked at the common workers
- scientific revolution started by craftsmen who became scientists
  1. theory: how machines work
  2. experimentation: trial and error, observation
  3. actual work/interaction with the devices
- tl;dr medieval craftsmen should be recognized as scientists
- they were doing it long before scientists called it science
- often, new process, technology, innovation would come from the working class
- e.g. John Harrison (the clock guy)
***** Harold Innis: Empure and Communications
- external approach
- scientific revolution happened because of free access to knowledge/communication
- i.e. modern science happened because of Gutenberg's press
- it removed the *gatekeepers* of the system
-
****** Before gutenberg press
if you wanted to publish, you had to go though the Roman Catholic Church
1. propose publication
2. gate keepers (Roman Catholic Church)
3. impact (small)
   - only a few copies made
****** After 1450
- gate keepers removed (Roman Catholic church can no longer control the spread of information)
- can pubilsh your own ideas without being censored by the Church
  1. Proposed publication/text print (on large scale)
     - government can no longer control because of massive scale
  2. impact of the work


** Mechanical Universe
*** Copernicus
- remember Claudius Ptolemy?
- first mathematical model of univerce with geocentrism and epicycles
- University of Krakow (Capital of Poland, one of the best universities in Poland, paid for by the King)
- poor student, had to move to Padua (he was the worst student in the class)
- at the time, medicine was the lowest level type of study
- probably killed more people than he cured
- not great at math
- part of scholastic movement (people who wanted to go back to the knowledge of the ancient Greeks)
- improved Ptolemy's system to make it work with the Platonic
  - Plato -- all motions in heaven are based on perfect circles
- realized the Sun must be in the center of the solar system
- 1543: De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium
  - waited till the last moment to publish, because he knew the Church would be upset
  - started Scientific revolution by questioning ancient laws of nature
  - book was forbidden by the Church until 1960s
  - because of the printing press, was not censored.
**** Small aside: remember the clock?
- c 1327 Richard of Wallingford
- time measured in the hands of machine
- no need to go outside and look at the sky to tell time
- machine replaced God
- clock had instant impact
- Nicholas Oresme
  - God is the supreme clocka (machine) maker
  - the world/universe is a machine
  - led to mechanical philosophy
  - everything out there can be explained with math, not god
*** Galileo
- first scientist who applied mechanical philosophy in his publications
- first major scientist who openly opposed Arisotelian logic
- promoted repeatable experimentation instead
- supported Copernical helopcentrism
- rejected Ptolemy's system
- used new technology: telescope
- one of first to use the telescope to look at the sky (it was used before to look at ships from the harbour)
- planets are not perfect spheres (Plato wrong)
  - saw craters on moon
- confirmed that the Earth moves around the Sun

**** Starry Messenger
- 1610
- against Aristotelian and Ptolemic systems
- Church: heresy!
- missing component in Astrarium
- the entire system was explained with mechanical components, no God
**** Social connections
- best childhood friend later became the Pope of Rome
- saved his life a bunch

**** Dialogue
- 1632
- play, comedy genre
- Prolemic and Copernican astronomer
- Pope
- dialogue between the different astronomers
- tl;dr the Copernican comes out of the conversation as someone smart, the others are called idiots (simplicio)
- Pope could no longer protect Galileo so he was finally burned alive
- tuens out it wasn't even the science that got him burned alive
**** Holy Inquisition
- 1633
- Galileo on trial
- the only way out is to be burned alive
- when you are brought to the trial, you hope to be burned alive
- before the trial you are tortured in unimaginable ways
- by the time you got to the trial, you already are tortured, parts of body removed (legs, breasts..)
- the end of the trial is the end of your misery
- when Galileo was brought to the trial, he was intact, no torture (because he was friends with the Pope)
- asked: If Eart moves around the sun, you must agree that the Earth is moving at a great speed
  - how is it possible that we do not feel the fast movement?
  - he could not prove it
- died in house arrest 1642
- could still see people
- basically got off the hook
**** Important takeaway
- shifted the question from why the nature/universe works to how it works
- because he used mechanical philosophy
- beginning of modern science - Britain (Protestants)

* Age of experimentation
** Lack of refrigeration and birth of experimentalism
- no refigeration = spoiled meat
- meat was restricted for upper classes
  - during religious festivals, Roman Catholic church would hand out meat to the masses
  - the meat was rotten
  - how to make rotten meat edible? (smell/taste)
  - throwing away food is sin, food is a gift from god
  - solution: spices
  - except there are no spices in Europe
  - need to import from the East (Arabs), trade for gold
  - Arabs were more advanced than the Europeans
  - black pepper worth more than gold
  - another problem: no gold in Europe

*** Alchemy
- Physica et mystica
  - Alexandrian work
- Razy Al: The secrete of Secrets
  - Arab scholar
  - book was about faking gold from other  metal/s
**** 2 goals:
***** elixir of life
- also philosppher's stone
***** transmutation
- take garbage metal and try to turn it into gold
**** James Price
- the last true alchemist
- bestseller book on "making gold from mercury"
- Royal society invited him to present a demo
  - goes to present
  - says I'll be right back
  - kills himself
**** facts
- first groupp of people to use experimental approach
  - creating things that don't exist in nature
- by 1600s producing dyes, perfumes
  - people realized that making gold is a scam
  - used to come from the East
  - Alchemists became useful, creating new things
- alchemy evolved into chemistry
- most famous scienteists were alchemists
  - Robert Boyle: Sceptical Chymist
    - the book is basically an attack on alchemy (ironic)
    - today known as the father of chemisty lol

** Religion and experimentalism
- Britain
*** Francis Bacon
- wealthy, powerful individual
- new method (experimentalism) to undermine Aristotle
- methodilogy for eatablishing facts
- 5 rules by which laws of nature will be discovered:
  1. repeatable experiments
  2. reductionism
     - remember Democratus, the guy who came up with the concept of an atom?
     - take what you have, break it into components until it cannot be reduced further
  3. objectivity
     - today, the outcome of science experiments depends on who is funding you
     - today, it's not objective unfortunately
  4. public witnessing
  5. scientific publications
- till this day, we follow the Baconian system made in the 1600s
**** Instauratio Magna
- for the benefit of mankind
- if we use this methodology, we'll discover everything
- knowledge = power, that's where this saying comes from
  - Ipsa scientia potestas est
- once we discover everything, we should use it for the benefit of mankind
- is science and technology really used for the benefit of mankind? (something to think about)
- around this time, Galileo is under house arrest, people are being burned for rejecting Aristotelian logic
-
*** Robert Merton
- Britain
- protestant country
- pope of Rome did not have authority over what happens
- no holy inquisition
- Puritans supported Bacon's ideas, criticized ancient knowledge
- Puritans were trying to get rid of Greek ideas from Christianity
- common goals, kind of. Bacon wanted to get ancient greek ideas out of modern science
- religion positive impact for once
- foundation of Royal Society
*** Royal Society
missing a system for collecting knowledge

women were kept out, could not become scientists, investors or engineers

not allowed to present in front of the Royal society

1. lowest level: merchants of light
   - sea captains
   - people who travel and bring samples of plants, animals, people
   - ex: James Cook
   -
2. Depredators
   - people who would go to archives around the world, synthesize it, and see if anything is worth investigating further
3. Mystery Men
   - people who'd dress up as common workers and try to steal secrets from guilds
   - didn't work very well
4. Pioneers or Miners
   - experiments
5. Compilers
   - updated Baconian tables
   - didn't last, too complex
6. Benefactors
   - important
   - gatekeepers of the system
   - they decide what gets investigated further, and what isn't
7. Inoculators
   - unimportant
8.  Lamps
   - unimportant
9. Interpreters of Nature
   - Isaac Newton
   - most power
   - decide what the final overall laws were
**** Harrison
- basically, Harrison (clock guy) could not make it past the Benefactors
- same thing for most women
**** other facts
- purely funded based on Baconian system
- started by Boyle and Bacon
- not sponsored by the crown
- privately funded (unlike Academy of Sciences 1666-France)
- French academy was like Mouseion from ancient Alexandira
  + paid for by the crown
  + governmenr would dictate what science would do
- scientists could investigate whatever they wanted to
  + unaffected by government
**** Middle class
- basically, spanish lost lots of wars
- the gold they took from the Aztecs got distributed throughout Europe
- birth of capitalism
- new middle class
- people with money, but no titles like the upper class people
- one goal: making lots of money
- people realized that if you hire scientists, inventors, they can come up with new inventions, tools, processes that can make you wealthy
  - middle class funded Royal Society
  - protestant religion supported growing wealth
  - leads to industrial revolution
**** Kathleen Lonsdale
- first female admitted to the Royal society
- 1600- 1945 no women in the Royal society
** "The holy other" - Isaac Newton and experimental approach
- hated women
- thought women were responsible for everything negative
- 1703 head of Royal society
- last known words are: "Thank god I'm dying a virgin"
